# reactGame

Hello there my Projet s a video game! I realized it just for fun and learn the differents techno I used (Reactjs, redux, typeScript) I know I probably did a lot of misstakes, and Thanks to don't blame me. If you can notify me about some problem or bad habbit, it's will be an honor to understand what wrong or bad habbit I did.

I give the sources of my tutorial I used to begin this projet. If you are interressed go ahead!
